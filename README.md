1. One additional visualization is creating a map of the trips, filtering for the busiest weekdays and hours, and adding in additional data on landmarks, businesses near those destinations and start points

2. Another visualization that can be created is displaying the number of trips and duration of trips by bike id, identifying which bikes needs the most maintenance or can be rotated to other locations
